![Galata Tower in new year's eve.](/images/galata.jpg)

During my time at West Point, I got the chance to attend a special seminar by Ph.D. Howard G. Adams. Professor Adams was devoted to motivating young people to become a Ph.D. as well. After an eye opening and encouraging seminar, he handed out a list of rules to live by, if we wanted to achieve our full potential. This list has been hanging on my pinboard since the day I received it and it has become my go to advisor whenever I accepted a new challenge in my life. 

Recently I have been up to new challenges and as the number of the challenges I accepted increased my willingness to do them decreased as a result of devestation and a lack of motivation. Today I decided to review the rules Proffessor Adams has given to me, with a modern friend of mine, ChatGPT.

I prompted each item in the list to ChatGPT, and it gave a paragraph of explanation related to the sentence. I found reading the machines perspective on the sentences useful for reflecting on these advices. Here are the "Essentials for Tapping One's Full Potential" and ChatGPT's take on them:

## Abandon nine-to-five mentality.

The "nine-to-five" mentality refers to the traditional work schedule of working 8 hours a day, five days a week, typically from 9am to 5pm. This mentality can be limiting because it assumes that all work must be done during these specific hours.

Abandoning the nine-to-five mentality means being more flexible with your work schedule and being open to different ways of working. This can include:

**Remote work**: working from home or other location, this can help to reduce the need to be physically present in an office.

**Flexible hours**: working outside of traditional 9-5 hours, this allows you to work when you are most productive, whether that be early in the morning or late at night.

**Job sharing**: working part-time or sharing a full-time job with another person to better balance work and personal life.

**Freelancing or self-employment**: working for yourself, this allows you to set your own hours and take on projects as you see fit.

Abandoning the nine-to-five mentality can help you achieve a better work-life balance, increase productivity, and reduce stress. It's important to keep in mind that every person is different and what works for one person may not work for another, it's best to experiment different ways of working and find what works best for you.

## Accept failure as an opportunity to learn.

Accepting failure as an opportunity to learn is an important mindset to adopt in order to achieve success. Failure can be a valuable learning experience that helps you to understand your strengths and weaknesses, and to identify areas for improvement.

When you accept failure as an opportunity to learn, you are more likely to take risks, try new things, and push yourself out of your comfort zone. This can lead to personal growth and development, and ultimately, to greater success.

Here are a few ways to help you accept failure as an opportunity to learn:

**Reframe your thinking**: Instead of thinking of failure as a setback, think of it as a learning experience.

**Reflect on the experience**: Take time to reflect on what went wrong and what you can learn from it.

**Seek feedback**: Ask others for feedback and perspective on the situation.

**Take action**: Use the lessons you've learned to make positive changes and improve your performance.

**Stay positive**: Keep a positive attitude and don't let failure discourage you. Remember that failure is a natural part of the learning process.

Remember that failure is not the opposite of success, it's a part of it. Every successful person has failed many times before they achieve their goals. Failure is a stepping stone to success, it's an opportunity to learn, and it's a way to become better.

## Act like you belong; function with a purpose.

Acting like you belong and functioning with a purpose can help you to be more confident and effective in any situation.

When you act like you belong, you project an air of confidence and self-assurance. You carry yourself with a sense of purpose, and you are less likely to doubt yourself or second-guess your actions. This can make you more effective in any situation, whether it's a job interview, a presentation, or a social event.

Functioning with a purpose means having a clear goal or objective in mind, and working towards it. This can help you stay focused, motivated and be more productive. When you act with purpose, you are able to prioritize your tasks and make decisions with more clarity.

Here are a few tips to help you act like you belong and function with a purpose:

Overall, acting like you belong and functioning with a purpose can help you to be more confident, effective, and successful in any situation.

## Believe in yourself.

Believing in yourself is essential to achieving success in any area of your life. It means having confidence in your abilities, trusting your decisions, and knowing that you can handle any challenges that come your way.
